                <br />
                "Yet in positioning itself as techâ€™s moral compass, academic computer science belies
                the fact that its own intellectual tools are the source of the technology industryâ€™s
                dangerous power. A significant part of the problem is the kind of ideology it instills
                in students, researchers, and society at large. Itâ€™s not just that engineering education
                teaches students to think that all problems deserve technical solutions...the curriculum
                is built around an entire value system that knows only utility functions, symbolic manipulations,
                and objective maximization."
                <br />
                <br />
                "Boyd teaches this course once a year, and typically in the first lecture, he declares:
                'Everything is an optimization problem.' The claim reeks of techno-utilitarian naÃ¯vetÃ©,
                with its suggestion that every object can be modeled as a bunch of numbers, every human
                desire expressed in a utility function, every problem resolvable using the more or less
                crude calculation devices in our pockets."

                "Substack has some social features, like comments sections and discussion threads, but the
                newsletter ecosystem seems to lack the camaraderie that animated blogging communities.
                Unlike blogs, which link to other blogs almost as an ontological condition, most newsletters
                are impossible to find without an external referral or recommendation...Reggie James, the
                founder of Eternal, a social network in development, and the author of 'Product Lost,' a
                newsletter that takes an artistic, humanist approach to technology (free), was skeptical
                of the idea that Substack was an antidote to social media; about half his readers come through
                social networks. As long as writers were beholden to the logic of social-media algorithms, he said,
                Substack was still 'playing the game of the platforms.'"

                True public spaces, the most obvious examples being parks and libraries, are places for â€” and thus the spatial

                involves a difficult, awkward, ambiguous encounter between two differently shaped bodies that are themselves
                ambiguous â€” and this meeting, this sensing, requires and takes place in time. Not only that, due to the effort
                of sensing, the two entities might come away from the encounter a bit differently than they went in."

                "Every person has two choices for how to cope with any aspect of society that is uncomfortable: act

                right to take up space in the world, can engulf entire lives. Given the booster shot of a school or
                education system, it can swallow whole communities. This makes miseducation so enticing as a means of
                social control that it recurs again and again, in an endless variety of contexts."

                <br />
                "The childrenâ€™s native tongues were clipped from them, their hair was ripped from them, their clothes
                were stripped from them, and they were sent to live in the white culture, in hopes that they would
                find white tongues and hair and clothes. In many cases, they did not. 'As a result,' the report found,
                'many return to the reservations disillusioned,' bereft of the great asset of their cultures. Â¶ <i>Grandma,
                I donâ€™t understand you</i>, they would say. And their grandmothers would respond, <i>Then who are you?</i>{` `}

                "In <i>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</i>, the artist expounds gorgeously on the hard-won knowledge she earned
                on her ascent to the height of the music industry and into motherhoodâ€”lessons on love and money, fame and
                family, power and principles. Twenty years later, as Hill toured with these songs in 2018, the album still
                felt like a message out of time, as resonant as it ever was, despite the fact that Hill was just beginning
                her 20s when she made it. In the confidence of her flow, the lavish rasp of her alto, the iconic,
                unmistakable production choices, she sounds impossibly wise, wiser than most grown-ups could ever hope to be."

                still the case in 2010, when Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg gave Newark $100 million to transform its
                education system. The gift, as Dale Russakoff recounts in her definitive book, The Prize, reflected a grand
                bargain between Zuckerberg and Chan, Newarkâ€™s then-mayor Cory Booker, and New Jerseyâ€™s then-governor Chris
                Christie. The three parties sought to demonstrate that with the right leadership, empowered by the state
                to put in place new, proven approaches to education, Newarkâ€™s schools could become a model for cities
                around the country in only five years. That aim, Russakoff argued, helped to doom the popularity of the
                groupâ€™s reforms among residents. 'The language of national models,' she wrote, 'left little room for
                attention to the unique problems of Newark, its schools, or its children.'"

                "If a school is devised purely as an escape route to a different world, he believed, then it will teach
                students only the information required to exist in that other world. The students will emerge knowing
                nothing about their environment except why and how to leave it, leaving them incapable of understanding
                it, much less improving it."

                "'If you understood who you are,' Ras Baraka once said, 'you would understand that the world belongs to
                you. And you shouldnâ€™t claim a piece of it, you should claim all of it. And when you begin to claim all
                of it, you fight for the whole of humanity.'"
